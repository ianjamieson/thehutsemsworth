                        Then all you need to do to redeem it is visit us at <ButtonGoogleMaps>Thornham Marina</ButtonGoogleMaps>

                        then you will keep the remaining balance. However, if your order value is higher than your gift card balance, then
                        you will just need to pay the difference.
