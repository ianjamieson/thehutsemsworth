                    <p>
                        As we have such a small space in the trailer we cannot cater for all dietry requirements.
                        However, we do have the following options:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong className="font-bold underline">Vegetarian</strong><br/>
                        We have various vegetarian options on the menu, these are marked accordingly. Please ask
                        a member of staff if you have any further questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pesto in the Sunblushed Tomato & Feta Panini is also vegetarian as it does not
                        contain parmesan.
